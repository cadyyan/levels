# Levels Mod

The Levels mod adds RPG like levels to Minecraft. Levels allow you to restrict recipes to players that have completed
enough crafts or performed enough tasks to have the experience required to craft the item.

## Building the mod

Levels uses ForgeGradle so building this is just like building just about any other mod. If you don't have Gradle
installed on your system (as its not required) you can do one of the following commands (the first is for Linux/Unix and
the send is for Windows):

    ./gradlew build
    gradlew.bat build

Note that you will need to setup the workspace accordingly with the correct Gradle task for your environment.
