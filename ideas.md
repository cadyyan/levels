# Ideas

* Restrict access to certain tools based on level (ie. can't use a diamond sword till level 40)
* Perks/bonuses for higher levels (ie. better combat skills mean high DPS and better defence)
* Integration with mods such as HQM
* Give player's a hint that they are trying to make a recipe that they don't have the skill for
